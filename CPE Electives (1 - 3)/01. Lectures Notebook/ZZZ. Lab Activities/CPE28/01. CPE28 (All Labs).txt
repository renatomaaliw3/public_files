Lab Number 03: KMeans Clustering with Dimensionality Reduction (All Labs)

Instructions

a. From the Dataset repository load (personnel_data.csv)
b. We will used random_state = 101, and n_init = 'auto' for KMeans

Answer the following (Write your answer on your paper)
* For numbers with decimal values, up to two decimal places without rounding *

1. Without using correlational analysis, which two (2) variables do you think is safe to eliminate immediately?

Please scale the cleaned data using a StandardScaler()

2. What is now the scaled value for Salary of data 125?
3. What is now the scaled value for Experience of data 130?

Next, please reduced the variables using correlational analysis.

4. If we set a threshold of greater than 0.66 (absolute) and above, which do you think (variable) will be eliminated?

To set uniformity in elimination, eliminate the variable/s first based on alphabetical order.
(Eg. If Assignments and Grades is highly correlated, eliminate Assignments)

5. Based on Elbow Graph or S-Scores, what is the optimal number of clusters?
6. Based on boxplots or any method, which cluster has the higher salary?
7. Based on boxplots or any method, which cluster has the higher age?
8. Data 305 belongs to what cluster after implementation of K-Means clustering with the optimized number of K?
09. What is the centroid of Age and Salary? (Eg. [0.11, 0.21])

10. Based on the visualization, does age matter in having higher salary? 
      Explain why in your own perspective based on data.

I will check the following on your emailed NOTEBOOK:

a. Visualize the x = Age and y = Salary points, Show Data 305 with marker of star (*), color red, Show centroids with black (X) mark.
b. Visualize the x = Age, y = Salary, and z = JobSatisfaction points, Show or Trace Data 305 with black circle, using scatter_3D.
