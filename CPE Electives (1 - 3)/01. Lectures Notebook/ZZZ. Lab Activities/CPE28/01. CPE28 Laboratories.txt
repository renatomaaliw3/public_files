LAB ACTIVITY NUMBER 2 (10 Items on Paper with submitted Notebook) 
KMeans Clustering with Dimensionality Reduction

Instructions

a. From the Dataset repository load (personnel_data.csv)
b. We will use random_state = 101, and n_init = 'auto' for KMeans

Answer the following (Write your answer on your paper)
* For numbers with decimal values, up to two decimal places without rounding *

1. Without using correlational analysis, which two (2) variables do you think is safe to eliminate immediately?
   Remove it from the dataset.

Please normalize the cleaned data from Number 1 using a StandardScaler()

2. What is now the scaled value for Salary of data 125?

3. What is now the scaled value for Experience of data 130?

Next, please reduced the variables using correlational analysis.

4. If we set a threshold of greater than 0.66 (absolute), which do you think (variable) will be eliminated?
   To set uniformity in elimination, eliminate the variable/s first based on alphabetical order. 
   (Eg. If Assignments and Grades is highly correlated, eliminate Assignments)

   Remove from the scaled dataset the highly correlated variable/s

5. Based on Elbow Graph or S-Scores Visualizer, what is the optimal number of clusters?

6. Based on boxplots or any method, which cluster has the higher salary?

7. Based on boxplots or any method, which cluster has the higher age?

8. Data 305 belongs to what cluster after implementation of K-Means clustering with the optimized number of K?

9. What is the centroid/s for Age and Salary? (Eg. Cluster 0 [0.11, 0.21], Cluster 1 [0.22, 0.33])

10. Based on the clustering visualization, 
    does age matter in having higher salary? Explain why in your own perspective.

I will check the following on NOTEBOOK:

a. Visualize the x = Age and y = Salary, Show Data 305 with marker of star (*), color red, Show centroids with black (X) mark.
b. Visualize the x = Age, y = Salary, and z = JobSatisfaction, Show or Trace Data 305 with black circle, using scatter_3D.

   Please drop the column you deemed to be irrelevant for clustering

   Before scaling the data using a Standard Scaler, please encode (dummy variables) the column 'origin' into 0s and 1s
