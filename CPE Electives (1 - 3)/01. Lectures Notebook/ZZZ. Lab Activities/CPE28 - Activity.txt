K-Means Clustering Lab Activity Number 1 (10 Items)

Instructions:

a. From the Dataset repository load (personnel.csv)
b. We will use random_state = 101, and n_init = 'auto' for KMeans

Answer the following (Write the answer on your paper):

1. If we select 'Experience' and 'Salary', what is the optimized number of clusters?

2. What is the silhouette score of the most optimized number of clusters?

3. Based on your visualization and data extraction, what is the centroid for each clusters?
   Example, "Cluster 0 [22.99, 33.33], Cluster 1 [10.15, 18.53], Cluster 2 [9.85, 6.85]"

4. Interpret your visualization on what is the salary's relation to experience or vice-versa.
5. What will be your descriptive names for each cluster?
