INSTRUCTIONS:
A. For numerical answers (2 decimals, no rounding)
B. Load dataset 'time_series_data_018.csv'


Week 7 Lab

Using Exponential Smoothing, answer the following

1. What is the best model for the time series data.
   A. SES
   B. DES
   C. TES

2. If DES, write the trend category (additive or multiplicative)
   If TES, write the trend category (additive or multipicative)
           write the seasonal category (additive or multiplicative)
           write the optimal seasonal period (3?, 5?, 21?, 30?, etc.)

3. Using your best model, write the MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE values.
4. Using your best model (at 30 days test set), what is the forecast at 2022-05-22?
5. Using your best model (with forecast horizon of 30), what is the forecast at 2022-06-08?

Week 8 Lab

Using ARIMA, SARIMA, answer the following

1. What is the best model for the same time series?
   A. ARIMA
   B. SARIMA

2. If ARIMA, write the best configuration, e.g. ARIMA(1,0,1)
   If SARIMA, write the best configuration, e.g. ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1,[30])

3. Using your best model, write the MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE values.
4. Using your best model (at 30 days test set), what is the forecast at 2022-05-22?
5. Using your best model (with forecast horizon of 30), what is the forecast at 2022-06-08?
6. Explain, why Exponential Smoothing is better than ARIMA, or ARIMA is better than Exponential Smoothing based on
   the comparative results.
