For Numbers 1 and 2

INSTRUCTION:

Use random_state = 42, when applicable
Use MinMaxScaler
Use PCA, 2 components only

Note: 
For Hierarchical Clustering use linkage of 'ward'


1. Identify the best clustering model for dataset 'cluster-02.csv'
   (e.g. KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering (HC), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM))

2. After identification of the best model, according solely to the best silhouette score,
   determine the number of clusters (e.g. 2?, 3? 4?, 5?, 6? 7?, n?)

- - x - - x - - x - - x

For Numbers 3 to 4

INSTRUCTION:

Use random_state = 42, when applicable
Use MinMaxScaler
Use PCA, 2 components only

4. Using DBSCAN identify the best epsilon value based on the best silhouette score alone.
   Use dataset 'cluster-05.csv'
   Use the best practice value for the number of minimum samples.

5. How many outliers are detected based from your DBSCAN model?
